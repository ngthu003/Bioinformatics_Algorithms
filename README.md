# Bioinformatics Algorithms

###### Background Information

> This repository is a collection of implementation of algorithms introduced in the book `Bioinformatics Algorithms - An Active Learning Approach` by Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner and the Coursera specialization __[Bioinformatics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)__.

> The implementation is done with Python. Each algorithm, when first introduced, is implemented in a separate Python notebook, and tested on a variety of dataset from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track), the complementary website.
